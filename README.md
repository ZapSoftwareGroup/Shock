# `Shock` File Manager

A (shock)ingly fast console file manager for Linux and OSX, written in Rust

## Why another file manager?

[ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) is featureful, but lacks speed. [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) is fast, but lacks features. Other common issues that Shock intends to solve include: ugly interfaces, difficult configuration, and general annoyances.

## Using Shock

Simply enter `shock` in the directory you want `Shock` to open.

### File manipulation

To delete a file: `dd`

To add a file: `+`

To rename a file: `r`

To select a file: `Shift+v`

### Configuration

As `Shock` is minimal software, you must configure it through the source code and compile. Configuration is typically found in the `config.rs` file.
